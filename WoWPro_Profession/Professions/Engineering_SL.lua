; What to Craft 097 to 100 Shadowlands
N Schematic: PHA7-YNX is basically the only recipe that you can't craft at this point.|N|But you can't buy the recipe until you reach Exalted reputation with the Ascended faction.\n\n Reaching exalted will probably take more than a month of grinding. \n\n I recommend doing the Engineering World Quest every few days for these last 3 points.|

N Congratulations on completing Shadowlands Engineering. |N|We hope you found this guide useful and reported any issues you came across.
