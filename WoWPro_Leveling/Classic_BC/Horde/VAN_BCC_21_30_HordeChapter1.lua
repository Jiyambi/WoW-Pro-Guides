Each one can be handled/pulled individually.\n[color=FF0000]NOTE: [/color]When you get to the top floor, Ordanus is inside flanked by two lv 26 Vindicators. There is no pulling them separately. Rush Ordanus and kill him as quickly as possibly. If you do not have any CC options, I recommend drawing them outside. That way, if you die after killing Ordanus, you can return and loot his head without worrying about the other two.|
