Go inside the tunnel behind the altar and fight your way through to the southernmost tip of the tunnel structure . There you should see Hitah'Ya the Keeper patrolling with two guards. Get full mana/hp. The trick here is to use crowd control (if you have, like ice trap, sheep, sap) and at the same time burn down Hitah'Ya as fast as possible (she has very little HP). Also pop your cooldown skills to burn down one of the guards as fast as possible. Once that is done you just need to deal with the other guard. Loot Hitah'Yah.|RANK|2|
