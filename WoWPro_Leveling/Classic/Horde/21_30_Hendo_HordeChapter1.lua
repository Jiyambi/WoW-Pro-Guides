Your best bet is to approach from the south behind the Forge. You can pull the mobs out front towards you away from the road.

;N Clerk Horrace Whitesteed|QID|567|N|He is not alone and you'll have to clear the room slowly to avoid getting overwhelmed with adds. You will have to pull the 2 mobs on the left side of the room from the entrance. The moment you enter the room, you will aggro everyone. I recommend using the front foyer as a pull area. Put as much distance between the main room and the runner as possible; and they will run. This will limit the chance of runners making it worse for you.\nIMO, because of the way it's set up, this one is the toughest of all 4.|
